What the CLI is trained to do:

- Assist in setting up token accounts for most traded tokens, useful for fee accounts to receive the platform fee
- Convert spill or fee tokens back to desired mint
- Provide the level of hygiene of a wallet

## To start

3. Run `yarn start help` to see all the commands. You can also run `yarn start help command` to see what each command is for.
